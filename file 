Great! Since you said “Yes please,” I’ll start with a simple guide and example to help you build a Visual Studio extension that offers custom IntelliSense/code completion suggestions, which is the closest practical way to script or extend IntelliCode-like behavior.

How to Build a Custom IntelliSense (Code Completion) Extension for Visual Studio 2022

Visual Studio IntelliCode itself doesn’t expose scripting interfaces, but you can create your own code completion providers using Visual Studio’s Roslyn APIs.

Overview Steps:

1. Set up your development environment for Visual Studio extensions.


2. Create a new VSIX Project in Visual Studio.


3. Add a Roslyn Completion Provider class.


4. Implement the logic to provide custom completion items.


5. Build and test your extension inside an experimental instance of Visual Studio.

Step 1: Set Up

Install Visual Studio 2022 with the Visual Studio extension development workload.

Optional but recommended: Install the Visual Studio SDK.



---

Step 2: Create a VSIX Project

Open Visual Studio 2022.

Create a new project.

Search for VSIX Project.

Name it something like CustomCompletionProvider.



---

Step 3: Add a Completion Provider

Add a new class file, e.g., MyCompletionProvider.cs.

Here’s a minimal example of a Completion Provider that suggests "HelloWorld" as a completion item:

using System.Collections.Immutable;
using System.Composition;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.CodeAnalysis;
using Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Completion;
using Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Text;

[ExportCompletionProvider(nameof(MyCompletionProvider), LanguageNames.CSharp)]
[Shared]
public class MyCompletionProvider : CompletionProvider
{
    public override async Task ProvideCompletionsAsync(CompletionContext context)
    {
        // Add "HelloWorld" as a completion suggestion
        var completionItem = CompletionItem.Create("HelloWorld");
        context.AddItem(completionItem);
    }

    public override bool ShouldTriggerCompletion(SourceText text, int position, CompletionTrigger trigger, 
                                                 OptionSet options)
    {
        // Trigger completion whenever a dot '.' is typed
        if (trigger.Kind == CompletionTriggerKind.Insertion && position > 0)
        {
            var ch = text[position - 1];
            return ch == '.';
        }
        return false;
    }
}


---

Step 4: Build and Run

Build the project.

Press F5 to launch the Experimental Instance of Visual Studio.

Open a C# file, and type . to trigger the completion.

You should see "HelloWorld" in the IntelliSense suggestion list.

Notes

This is a very basic example.

You can customize ProvideCompletionsAsync to provide suggestions based on context, syntax tree, or even external AI models.

You can combine this with other APIs for more powerful tooling.

If you want, I can help generate a full sample VSIX project, or help you script or extend it further (e.g., pull completions from your own dataset or AI model).

Would you like me to do that?
